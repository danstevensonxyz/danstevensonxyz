# Hi, I'm Dan
# Software developer, entrepreneur and problem-solver.

I am an entrepreneurial, technology-focused and proactive software developer with a track-record of getting things done! I strive to keep up to date with the latest technology trends, with my recent focus being React and decentralised applications.

With experience in various project team roles (developer, PM, BA, UX) I can contribute technical as well as non-technical insights to help the team achieve its goals. In the last few years I have founded two tech startups, worked in the private and public sectors, and have transitioned from project support to technical roles.

## About this repo

[This](https://github.com/DanStevensonCO/DanStevensonCO) is my personal site repo. The site ([DanStevenson.CO](https://www.danstevenson.co/)) is where I share my thoughts and experience working on software projects. It's a React app, built using a basic Gatsby starter to handle content management. It is hosted on Netlify, using continuous deployment through GitHub integration.
