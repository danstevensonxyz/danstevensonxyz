This week I started the remote coding bootcamp with Northcoders. It’s been a busy and interesting week, covering a lot of ground and brushing up on some of the topics I’ve covered as part of the preparation work for the course. 

##Monday

On the first day we had a quick intro to our tutors for the course and a classic icebreaker of going around the group asking for favourite biscuits (dark chocolate digestive for me).

The first lecture was on the command line, and the tutors emphasised the importance of getting used to navigating the computer on the CLI rather than GUI. We then had a lecture about using git and Github. I’ve done a bit on git/Github before, and although it has its complexities, I love the concept of having that project history and version control. We had a short lecture about basic JavaScript in the afternoon. 

Between each of the mini lectures we had tasks to complete covering the topic of the lecture. All work is done locally, most of it is tested using a CLI test suite (using node), and then committed to Github when complete. 

Each day ends with a wrap up 10 min session with the mentors, where students can share any questions or thoughts. 

##Tuesday

On Tuesday we had lectures on data, variables, expressions and functions. The most interesting lecture was about “understanding errors”. Errors are something that any developer encounters on a regular basis, and it’s important to be able to understand what went wrong before being able to try to fix it. 

The most common errors and the ones we covered in detail are: ReferenceError (e.g. when referencing an uninitialised variable), SyntaxError (e.g. typos, missing parentheses to close a function, etc.) and TypeError (e.g. when trying to reassign a value to a const).

##Wednesday

The first lecture of the day was on conditional logic. I’m pretty familiar with if statements and conditional logic, having worked a lot with building logic into online forms for the past year. 

The regex lecture included some stuff that I’ve been through before, but it always seems worth refreshing your memory with regexes. 

The arrays lecture and exercises covered the basic array methods of push, pop, shift, unshift, slice and splice. 

##Thursday

The iteration lecture and exercises were interesting and built on my experience with for loops. I like how intuitive for loops are — you’re specifying each step of the process explicitly, rather than having a lot of behind the scenes operations doing the heavy lifting. It’s also interesting to see a single block of code be able to execute multiple actions. I’m already pretty comfortable with for loops, but it was good to see how while and do… while loops can be used instead with slightly different syntax. 

##Friday

We ended the week with a couple of things completely new to me. 

‘exports’ and ‘require’ are methods needed to pass data from one JavaScript file to another, and not something that I’ve covered before. I’ve come across this concept before, but it was good to understand more about how it works in practice and to work on a few examples. 

We also covered the “execution context” model, which sort of made sense, but was a bit conceptual for a Friday afternoon!

##Summary

Overall it was a good intro week and opportunity to ease my way into the course. It’s slightly strange to have the course running fully remotely. Although I’ve been working remotely for the past 10 months, it’s mainly involved working with people I already know, and generally going a good job of replicating the interaction you’d get in the office (i.e. spending a healthy amount of time on Zoom standups discussing football/food/TV/other non-work stuff). I’m sure the personal interaction will increase over the next couple of weeks as we start doing more pair programming and group projects.
