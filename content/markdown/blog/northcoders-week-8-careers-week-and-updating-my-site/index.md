A slightly shorter post this week, mainly because I've already written about my work updating this site <a href="/projects/personal-website">here</a>. 

Basically I added some structure to the site to allow for project review posts to live at `/projects`, added a "recent projects" block to the homepage, and wrote up the reviews of my work at <a href="/projects/building-online-forms-at-sheffield-city-council/">Sheffield City Council</a> and <a href="/projects/versify-the-online-language-exchange/">Versify</a>. A lot of my time was spent writing the project reviews - they're fairly detailed and I'm not sure who the intended audience is! But I enjoyed writing them, and they give a pretty comprehensive review of the two projects most responsible for pushing me in the direction of software development as a career. 

The rest of my time was spent on careers-related work, as part of Northcoders' "Careers Week". This involved CV workshop sessions, information about tech tests and a talk from a hiring partner. 

It was definitely a change in pace from what I've been used to on the Northcoders course, but a good opportunity for me to update this site, think back to some of my recent projects and think forward to what I'd like to do after the course.
